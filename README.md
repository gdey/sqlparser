sqlparser
=========

This is copied directly from 
https://github.com/youtube/vitess/tree/master/go/vt/sqlparser 
with just a few modifications to make it work as a standalone repo.

There are, also, modifications to allow it to parse multiple sql statements in a file.
As well and an example program sqlfmt that will pretty print sql file provided to it.
Or show where the errors in the file are. It will only show the first error.
